## Stack
* Stacks are a **LIFO** data structure where the last value in is always the first one out.
* Stacks are used to handle function invocations(the call stack), for operations like **undo/redo**, and for routing(remember pages you have visited and go back/forward) and much more!
* They are not a built in data structure in JavaScript, but are relatively simple to implement.

### BigO of Stacks
* Insertion - O(1)
* Removal - O(1)
* Searching - O(N)
* Access - O(N)
