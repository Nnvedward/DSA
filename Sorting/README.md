## Sorting Algorithms

Sorting is the process of rearranging the items in a collection (e.g. an array) so that the items are in some kind of order. 

### Why learn sorting algorithms:  
* Sorting is an incredibly common task, so it's good to know how it works.
* There are many different ways to sort things, and different techniques have their own advantages and disadvantages.
* Sorting sometimes has quirks, so it's good to understand how to navigate them 

### Bubble Sort
A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top!


### Selection Sort
Similar to bubble sort, but instead of first placing large values into sorted positions, it places smalll values into sorted position.


### Insertion Sort
It builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger left half which is always sorted.


| Algorithm | Time complexity (Best) | Time complexity (Average) | Time complexity (Worst) | Space complexity |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------|------------------|
| Bubble Sort | O(n)                 | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)           |   
| Insertion Sort | O(n)                 | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)           |   
| Selection Sort | O(n^2)                 | O(n^2)                    | O(n^2)                  | O(1)           |
