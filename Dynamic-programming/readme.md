## Dynamic Programming
A method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblem, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions.

> It only works on problems with **Optimal substructure** and **Overlapping subproblems**

* **Overlapping subproblems:** A problem is said to have **overlapping subproblems** if it can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times.

* **Optimal substructure:** A problem is said to have **Optimal substructure** if an optimal solution of a bigger problem can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems.
