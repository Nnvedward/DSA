Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph

**Why is it useful:**
* GPS - finding fastest route
* Networking Routing - finds open shortest path for data
* Biology - used to model the spread of viruses amoung humans
* Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
* Many other uses!
