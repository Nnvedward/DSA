### Binary Heap
**Very** similar to a binary search  tree, but with some different rules! A binary heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first.

### Max Binary Heap
* Each parent has at most two child nodes.
* The value of each parent node is **always** greater than its child nodes.
* In a max Binary heap, the parent is greater than the children, but there are no guarantees between siblings nodes.

### Min Binary Heap
* Each parent has at most two child nodes.
* The value of each parent node is **always** lesser than its child nodes.
* In a min Binary heap, the parent is lesser than the children, but there are no guarantees between siblings nodes.
