### Hash Table
* Hash tabls are used to store *key-value* pairs.
* They are like arrays, but the keys are not ordered.
* Unlike arrays, hash tables are fast for all of the following operations: finding values. adding new values and removing values. 

**What makes a good hash?**
- Fast (i.e. constant time)
- Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly
- Deterministic (same input yields same output)
