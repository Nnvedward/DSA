### Trees
A data structre that consists of nodes in a **parent/child** relationship.

### Tree terminology
* **Root** - The top node in a tree.
* **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away fromthe root.
* **Parent** - The converse notion of a child. 
* **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent. 
* **Leaf** - A node with no children.
* **Edge** - The connection between one node and another.

### Example use cases for Trees
* HTML DOM
* Network Routing
* Abstract Syntax Tree
* Artificial Intelligence
* Folders in Operating Systems
* Computer File Systems


### Binary Search Trees
* Every parent node has at most **two** children.
* Every node to the left of the parent node is **always less** than the parent.
* Every node to the right of the parent node is **always greater** than the parent.
