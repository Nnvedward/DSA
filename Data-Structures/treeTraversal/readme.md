### Traversing a tree
**Two ways:**
* Breadth-first search
* Depth-first search(pre-order, post-order & in-order)
**-Inorder:** used commonly with binary search trees, gets all nodes in the tree in their underlying order.
**-PreOrder:** can be used to "export" a tree structure so that it is easily reconstructed or copied.
