## Searching Algorithms

# Linear Search

This is a pattern where you visit one element at a time starting at the beginning moving forward or from the end moving backwards.

**BIG O**
-Best case: O(1)  
-Average case: O(n)  
-Worst case: O(n)

# Binary Search

* Binary search is much faster than linear search
* Rather than eliminating one element at a time, you can eliminate half of the remaining elements at a time.
* Binary search only works on ***sorted arrays***

**BIG O**
-Best case: O(1)  
-Average case: O(log n)  
-Worst case: O(log n)

# Naive String Search
This is searching for substrings in a larger string.
