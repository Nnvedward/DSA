## Problem Solving Approach

* Understand the problem
* Explore concreate examples
* Break it down
* Solve/Simplify
* Look back and refactor

# Understanding the problem
* Can i restate the problem in my own words?
* What are the outputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?
* How should i label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

# Exploring concreate examples
* Start with simple examples
* Progress to more complex examples
* Explore examples with empty inputs
* Explore examples with invalid inputs

# Breaking it down
* Explicitly write down the steps you need to take

# Solve/Simplify
**Simplify**
* Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
* Temporarily ignore that difficulty
* Write a simplified solution
* Then incorporate that difficulty back in

# Look back and refactor
* Can you check the result?
* Can you derive the result differently?
* Can you understand it at a glance?
* Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
* Can you improve the performance of your solution?
* Can you think of ther ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem?
